## Introduction

This is a demo to use Redis cache - a platform for caching. Instead of running self-hosted caching database, I currently use the `Redis cloud` for the demonstration.

In this demo, the user can insert locations which defined by a coordinate (longitude, latitude) and its label. After that, they can use Redis cache to query the `nearest` location with the limited distance.

## How to use

### Environment setting

Because of using `Redis cloud`, you first need to register and create your own database. For the searching purpose, I use the `Redis search` module. At the next stage, create the `.env` file at the `/backend` folder to specify the path which is used to connect to your database:

```
REDIS_URL="redis://<username>:<password>@<public_endpoint>"
```

For instance, the connection string can be:

```
REDIS_URL="redis://default:abc123@redis-123.cloud.com:13245"
```

### Running application

Secondly, you must run the backend server before running the frontend server:

```bash
$ cd backend
$ npm start
```

```bash
$ cd frontend
$ npm start
```
